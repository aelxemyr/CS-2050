7. How would you map a key to a value as in the previous problem when 
the dictionary was first created as an empty dictionary? Write a short 
piece of code to create an empty dictionary and then map "Kent" to 
"Denise" and "Steve" to "Lindy".

    newDict = {}
    newDict["Kent"] = "Denise"
    newDict["Steve"] = "Lindy"

8. What method is called when x < y is written? In which class is the 
method a member? In other words, if you were presented with x < y in 
a program, how would you figure out which class you needed to examine 
to understand exactly what x < y meant?

    The __lt__(self,y) method of x is called when x < y is written.
    This method is a member of the class of which x is a member. In
    order to understand exactly what x < y  meant, it is necessary
    to examine the class definition of x to see how __lt__ is defined.

9. What method is called when x << y is written?

    The __lshift__(self,y) method is called when x << y is written.

12. Polymorphism and Operator Overloading are closely related concepts.
Can you briefly explain how the two concepts are similar and how Python
supports them?

    Operator overloading is a kind of polymorphism, in that operators
    can be implemented with different behaviors depending on the 
    class in which they are defined. Python supports this by allowing
    different methods with the same name to be defined in different
    classes.
